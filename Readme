 # Mr. Hyde is a post template generator for  Jekyll blogging engine.

 Basic functionality :
 - It will generate a markdown file with only YAML Front Matter but no actual post content.
 - The generated file will be in the format year-month-date-this-is-the-post-title.md.
 - The generated file will be copied into _posts folder.
 - The file will have basic YAML Front Matter.
    ---
    layout : default
    title  : This is the post title
    ---
 - For the above functionalities, mrhyde should accept the following switces from the commandline.
    -  --title "Title String" // This switch is compulsory
    -  --layout <layout-file-name> //Assuming that you have that layout in your _layouts folder.
    -  --date <date-string>
    If --layout is not given then that section will be left empty.
    If --date is empty then current date is chosen.
    Draft feature :
       --draft - If enabled, then the generated file is copied over to _drafts folder instead of _posts folder.
